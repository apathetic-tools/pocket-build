    This test verifies that invoking the CLI with `--watch`
    causes `main()` to call `watch_for_changes()` exactly as expected.

    The difficulty lies in how `main()` references `watch_for_changes`:
    it doesnâ€™t call `runtime_env.watch_for_changes` directly, but
    resolves it as a global symbol within its own function body.
    That means we must patch the *namespace of main()*, not the module itself.
