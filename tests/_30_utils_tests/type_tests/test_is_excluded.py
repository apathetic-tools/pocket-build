# tests/_30_utils_tests/is_excluded_raw.py
"""Tests for is_excluded_raw and its wrapper is_excluded.

Checklist:
- matches_patterns — simple include/exclude match using relative glob patterns.
- relative_path — confirms relative path resolution against root.
- outside_root — verifies paths outside root never match.
- absolute_pattern — ensures absolute patterns under the same root are matched.
- file_root_special_case — handles case where root itself is a file, not a directory.
- mixed_patterns — validates mixed matching and non-matching patterns.
- wrapper_delegates — checks that the wrapper forwards args correctly.
- gitignore_double_star_diff — '**' not recursive unlike gitignore in ≤Py3.10.
