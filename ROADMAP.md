# 🧭 Roadmap

## 🧰 CLI Parameters
Planned command-line flags for future releases:

- `--self-update` — update pocket-build itself  
- `--no-update-check` — skip automatic update check 

## ⚙️ Config File Enhancements

- [ ] Add key to disable update checks directly in config
- [ ] Provide a JSON Schema for validation and autocomplete  

## 🧩 Joiner Scripts (Build System)
Exploring bundling options for generating the single-file release:

- [ ] zip file: zipapp / shiv / pyinstaller --onefile

## 🧪 Tests

## 🧑‍💻 Development 
- [ ] Deploy action when I tag a release should create a release and attach it to the tagged release.

## 💡 Ideas & Experiments
Potential quality-of-life features:

- [ ] Implement `--watch` mode for live rebuilds  
- [ ] publish to PyPI, NPM, PACKAGIST, others?

> See [REJECTED.md](REJECTED.md) for experiments and ideas that were explored but intentionally not pursued.
