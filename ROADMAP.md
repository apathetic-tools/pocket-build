# 🧭 Roadmap

## 🧰 CLI Parameters
Planned command-line flags for future releases:

- `--self-update` — update pocket-build itself
- `--no-update-check` — skip automatic update check

## ⚙️ Config File Enhancements

- [ ] Add key to disable update checks directly in config
- [ ] Provide a JSON Schema for validation and autocomplete
- [ ] How is IncludePath dest configured in the config file and handled?

## 🧩 Joiner Scripts (Build System)
Exploring bundling options for generating the single-file release:

- [ ] zip file: zipapp / shiv / pyinstaller --onefile

## 🧪 Tests
- verify every function has test coverage
- check for redundant tests


## 🧑‍💻 Development


deployment
  - [ ] Deploy action when I tag a release should create a release and attach it to the tagged release.

review
  - [ ] main is just high level orchestration and making sure the right command is run
  
API
  - [ ] put utils into a submodule (as long as our sticher can handle it)
  - [ ] can utils/config be made into a single submodule? how does that play with the bundler?
  - [ ] clean up "base" to "root" and "_normalize_base_and_path()" to "_normalize_path_with_root()"
  - [ ] converge on single term for package/module vs singlefile vs pyz
  - [ ] do we want a way to dump the schema for documentation purposes?

utils
  - [ ] log(): I didn't know about Python.logging or logging.Logger.
  - [ ] log(): should it respect the env outside of runtime? atm CLI trumps env but it could set it too.
  - [ ] log(): why does LOG_LEVEL=silent not work in tests?
  - [ ] do things that call is_excluded need to check if root exists?

config_validate
  - [ ] key in wrong place: "Ignored watch_interval in build #0: applies only at root level (move it above your builds: block)." could use `ROOT_ONLY_HINTS = {"watch_interval": "move it above your builds list"}`
  - [ ] type examples for _infer_type_label(), TYPE_EXAMPLES, "key 'include' expected list[str], got int" could add "expected list[str] (e.g. ["src/", "lib/"]), got int"
  - [ ] if a build has no includes, warn
    - [ ] do we want a message if strict mode is off but we issued warnings reminding them about strict mode?
  - [ ] Return the summary object to your CLI for machine-readable reporting (--json).?

config_resolve
  - [ ] maybe abstract _normalize_base_and_path in config_resolve for _include, _exclude, and _out for if statement clarity

load_and_validate_config
  - [ ] you must specify a build, even if that is no build. we warn otherwise
  - [ ] _validate_typed_dict likely needs to check if required fields are present

documentation
  - [ ] where do we document the structure of the project? what do we document inside it vs here?
  - [ ] where do we do longer usage documentation? README can get a bit big
  - [ ] logo? images? icon? readme banner?

program flow
  - [ ] how do include path dest parameters get transfered in? from the CLI? from the config? do they work?
  - [ ] how does the "include dest" affect exclude paths?
  - [ ] review the run_build flow and private functions to make sure they are not full of while-debugging logic.
  - [ ] review/add/remove all debug/trace messages with an eye for issue reports

CLI
  - [ ] add [trace] Runtime: Python 3.12.3 (CPython)
      platform.python_version(), platform.python_implementation(), sys.version
  - [ ] add runtime cache to store last python version run (or maybe in their config if available?)
      Path.home() / ".pocket_build" / "runtime.json"
  - [ ] does wrong parameters hint suggestions?


## 💡 Ideas & Experiments
Potential quality-of-life features:

- [ ] split out and depend on a basic CLI module
- [ ] split out and depend on (dev-only) a make_script CLI
- [ ] split out and depend on (dev-only) a list-project CLI
- [ ] split out and depend on (dev-only) a pytest multi-target plugin
- [ ] publish to PyPI, NPM, PACKAGIST, others?
- [ ] Add partial “Gitignore-like” behavior for '**' matches in py3.10

## make_script TODO

- [ ] have it's own configuration file
- [ ] make it more agnostic (and not pocket-build specific)
- [ ] don't repeat files
- [ ] allow you to specify a file for order, then include the rest of the dir
- [ ] document decisions/rejected
- [ ] builds without a version should have timestamp

> See [REJECTED.md](REJECTED.md) for experiments and ideas that were explored but intentionally not pursued.
