# Rejected / Deferred Ideas

A record of design experiments and ideas that were explored but intentionally not pursued.


## ðŸ§® Incremental Rebuilds via SHA-256 Hashing
<a id="rej01"></a>*REJ 01 â€” 2025-10-15*  

### Context
Considered adding file hashing and diffing to skip copying unchanged files during builds.

### Reason for Rejection
- Adds complexity (state tracking, stale cleanup, cache invalidation)
- Negligible performance benefit for typical workloads (dozens of files)
- Opposes the projectâ€™s design principle of deterministic, disposable builds

### Revisit If
- Builds exceed ~10k files
- Persistent caches are implemented
