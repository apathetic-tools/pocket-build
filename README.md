📘 **[Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)** · 📝 **[Release Notes](https://github.com/apathetic-tools/pocket-build/releases)**

**A tiny build system that fits in your pocket.**  
*Because not everything needs a toolchain.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

The self-contained executable script lives at [**`bin/pocket-build.py`**](./bin/pocket-build.py).  
The only requirement is **Python 3.8+** — no pip, no dependencies.

Download or copy that one file anywhere and run it directly:

```bash
python3 pocket-build.py
```

That’s it. ✨

Everything else in this repo (tests, docs, configs) exists only for developing and maintaining the script itself.

### ⚖️ License
- [MIT-NOAI License](LICENSE)

You’re free to use, copy, and modify the script under the standard MIT terms.  
The additional rider simply requests that this project not be used to train or fine-tune AI/ML systems until the author deems fair compensation frameworks exist.  
Normal use, packaging, and redistribution for human developers are unaffected.

## 🧩 Run It as a Script

If you prefer a direct executable:

```bash
chmod +x pocket-build.py
./pocket-build.py
```

You can even drop it somewhere on your `PATH` for easy use.

## 💡 Why Python? Other Language Versions?

You don’t need a native build.  
Python 3 ships with most Linux distributions. On Mac, it's one homebrew command away. On Windows, running the script automatically prompts the user to install Python from the Microsoft Store.

Pocket-build is meant to live comfortably next to your other tools — Go, Node.js, Rust, whatever — when all you need is a simple, dependency-free way to copy and package files.

## 🪶 Summary

**Use it. Hack it. Ship it.**
It’s MIT-licensed, minimal, and meant to stay out of your way — just with one polite request: don’t feed it to the AIs (yet).
